For the second time, we have taught the module Formal Methods for Software Engineering (FM4SE) at Bauhaus-University Weimar. This time, we have [recorded the lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGyeoukah9Nbd1yRDj3ridE7PtcL91-5u) and uploaded them to YouTube.

The lecture has been developed over the last two years with feedback from students and teaching assistants at Bauhaus-University Weimar. The materials are based on lectures by [Allison K. Sullivan](https://allisonius.github.io/) (selected SMT and Alloy materials) and [Shahar Maoz](https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~maozs/) (selected LTL materials).
