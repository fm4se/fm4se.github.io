Weâ€™re thrilled to announce that the [FM Playground](https://play.formal-methods.net/) has successfully migrated back to its main production server at Bauhausstrasse 11. The past month saw some major changes, including the relocation of the Faculty of Media. During this period, we temporarily ran the playground on a small virtual machine to ensure continued access for our users. Now, with the migration complete, our platform is operating with full computational resources again, delivering a much more robust and responsive experience.

With everything back in place, weâ€™re already planning the next set of updates. In the coming days, you can look forward to new features, including extended language support for various formal methods tools. Our goal is to make the FM Playground even more versatile and user-friendly for researchers, students, and anyone interested in formal methods.

We invite you to explore the upgraded playground and take advantage of the newly restored resources. Whether for education, research, or experimentation, weâ€™re here to support your journey.
